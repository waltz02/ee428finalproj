Code for EE428 Final Project, Chess Piece Classifier

Uses the following dataset: https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/chess-full/23

Categorizes annotated bounding boxes as one of 12 piece types using OpenCV's K-NN algorithm with a 66% success rate

be warned, i am certain there is a memory leak somewhere as my computer crashed after running it too many times
